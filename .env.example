# Zipline Native Client Configuration Example
# These are build-time variables - use them when building the APK

# OAuth Configuration (Optional)
# If not set, the app will use https://[your-zipline-domain]/app/oauth-redirect
# Set this if your Cloudflare Worker is on a different domain
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=https://oauth-worker.example.com/app/oauth-redirect

# Example build commands:

# Default build (OAuth uses Zipline domain):
# flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi

# Build with custom OAuth URL:
# flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi --dart-define=OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=$OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL

# Note: These are NOT runtime variables. They must be set during build time.
# The app cannot read .env files at runtime - use --dart-define when building.
